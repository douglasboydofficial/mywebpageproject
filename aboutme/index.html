    <p>
        Hello, everyone. As the heading suggests, my name is Douglas Boyd, but you can call me Doug if <br>
        you want. I was a computer science major but at as of this semester, I'm a cybersecurity major pursuing <br>
        a BS. I like to think of myself as a renaissance man in spirit. Meaning, I have many interests but <br>
        never act on any of them. My main hobbies however include cooking and hiking. I like to learn <br>
        new skills too. I am married to my beautiful wife Maddie, and we'll have been married for 3 years <br>
        coming up in August.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am currently work remotely for a company based out of Logan, Utah called Conservice. They are a company <br>
        that manages utilies for properties around the U.S. I work in a data based role for them. My favorite scripture <br>
        is 2 Nephi 4:16-23. It is a comfort to me to see someone as strong as Nephi deal with his inadequicies and still <br>
        serve the Lord. My favorite apostle is D. Todd Christofferson. I also served a mission in the Indiana Indianapolis <br>
        Mission.
